## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(readxl)
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
#https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/state/ accessed 08.11.2021
annual_generation_state <- read_excel("annual_generation_state.xls", 
    sheet = "Net_Generation_1990-2020 Final", 
    col_names = FALSE)
annual_generation_state <- annual_generation_state[-c(1),]
names(annual_generation_state) <- as.matrix(annual_generation_state[1, ])
annual_generation_state <- annual_generation_state[-1, ]
annual_generation_state[] <- lapply(annual_generation_state, function(x) type.convert(as.character(x)))
annual_generation_state <- annual_generation_state %>% pivot_wider(names_from = `ENERGY SOURCE`, values_from = `GENERATION (Megawatthours)`)


```

```{r}

    delim = ";", escape_double = FALSE, locale = locale(), 
    trim_ws = TRUE) %>% separate(col = 'State / Population',into = c('State','Population'),sep = "/") %>% separate(col = 'Average Wind Speed â–¼',into = c('Average Wind Speed','UnitWind'),sep = " ") 
averageWindstr <- str_trim(averageWind$State,side = c("right"))

```
```{r}

j4 <- left_join(j5,USStatesRename,by = c("GeoName"="Name"))
j4 <- j4 %>% drop_na(Postal)
totalData <- left_join(annual_generation_state,j4,by=c("STATE"="Postal"))

colnames(totalData)[17] <- "Solar"
```
# Export the data into a CSV

```{r}
write.csv(totalData,"totalData.csv", row.names = FALSE, na="0")
```
```{r}
```
```{r}
```
```{r}
```
```{r}

```{r}
```




Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
